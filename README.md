# SiLLM - Silicon LLM Training & Inference
The goal of this project is to streamline running and training LLMs on Apple Silicon using the [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/) framework. The code is based on the [MLX Examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples) repository but development is focused on implementing new features to run with MLX.
