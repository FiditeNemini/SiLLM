# SiLLM - Silicon LLM Training & Inference Toolkit
SiLLM simplifies the process of training and running Large Language Models (LLMs) on Apple Silicon by leveraging the [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/) framework. Building upon the foundation provided by [MLX Examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples), this project introduces additional features specifically designed to enhance LLM operations with MLX.
